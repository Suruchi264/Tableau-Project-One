The dashboard from Prism Insurance Pvt. Ltd. represents a rich visualization of insurance operations powered by a dataset stored and processed in Microsoft SQL Server. Various operations such as data filtering, aggregation, and categorization were performed on this dataset using SQL queries, and the cleaned results were then visualized to present key performance metrics and customer insights.

At the top level, the dashboard showcases three vital metrics: the total premium amount collected stands at ₹5.98 million, the coverage amount totals ₹600.55 million, and the total amount claimed is ₹16.91 million. These figures give an immediate sense of the financial scale of the business.

From a demographic perspective, the insurance customer base is almost perfectly balanced in gender, with 5,003 male and 5,001 female customers. This suggests the company has achieved gender equity in outreach or policy adoption. A donut chart illustrates the policy activity status, showing that 58.13% of the policies are active, while 41.87% are inactive. This highlights that although a majority of policies are maintained, a significant number have become dormant or expired, pointing toward opportunities for re-engagement.

The premium amount distribution by policy type reveals that travel insurance is the highest contributor at ₹2.5 million. It is followed by health insurance at ₹1.2 million and auto insurance at ₹1.0 million. Smaller contributions come from life and home insurance at ₹0.7 million and ₹0.6 million respectively. This pattern indicates a customer preference or business focus on travel-related coverage, which may have higher risk and thus higher premiums.

The claim amount by age group further breaks down the data, with adults accounting for the highest claim amount at ₹8.8 million, followed by elders with ₹6.4 million and young adults at ₹1.7 million. This suggests that adults are the primary insurance claimants, potentially due to higher activity levels and risk exposure.

Another key insight comes from the claim status distribution, where 4.4K claims were rejected, 3.4K were settled, and 2.3K remain pending. Rejections outnumber both pending and settled claims, indicating potential issues in policy terms, customer understanding, or claim processing efficiency.

A detailed bar and table view displays how different policy types perform in terms of claim outcomes. For instance, health and travel policies show high volumes in all categories — pending, rejected, and settled. Specifically, travel policies face the most rejections, hinting at either stringent claim requirements or a higher rate of unverifiable claims.

All these insights are driven by backend SQL operations, where data was queried, grouped, filtered, and processed using SQL Server functions. This backend processing ensured efficient performance and accurate data representation in the visual layer of the dashboard.

In summary, this dashboard not only offers an at-a-glance view of Prism Insurance’s operations but also demonstrates the power of integrating SQL Server-based data processing with dynamic visualization tools. The insights can inform strategic decisions on policy development, risk management, customer engagement, and claims processing.
