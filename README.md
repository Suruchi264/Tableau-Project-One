# Student Depression Analysis

The dashboard you've shared presents an insightful analysis of various factors affecting students, particularly focusing on their academic experience and well-being. It visualizes the relationship between several key variables—Sleep Duration (SD), Study Hours (SH), Study Satisfaction (SS), Academic Pressure (AP), and Financial Stress (FS)—with the corresponding Student Count (SC) for each category.

The Sleep Duration & Student Count section uses bubble charts to show how many students fall into each category of sleep duration. The size and repetition of values indicate consistent sleep durations among student groups, with 123 and 128 students falling into specific categories.

The Study Hours & Student Count area is depicted with a line graph, reflecting variation in student numbers across different study hour ranges. This visualization reveals fluctuations in study behavior, with student count peaking at 53 and dipping to as low as 29.

The Study Satisfaction & Student Count section uses bar charts to show how student satisfaction (ranked from SS 1 to SS 5) correlates with the number of students. Notably, Study Satisfaction level 4 has the highest count (116 students), suggesting that most students rated their satisfaction around this level.

The Academic Pressure & Student Count chart is represented with square markers, showing how different levels of academic pressure affect student distribution. The largest group (125 students) reported an academic pressure level of 3, indicating a mid-range pressure being most common.

Lastly, the Financial Stress & Student Count section uses circular markers to highlight how financial stress is distributed among students. Stress levels are relatively evenly spread, but FS 1 (lowest stress) has the highest number of students (110), implying a slight tilt toward lower perceived financial pressure.

Overall, this dashboard provides a well-rounded overview of student life, linking academic habits and external pressures to satisfaction and well-being. It’s valuable for identifying stress points and areas that may require institutional support or intervention.
